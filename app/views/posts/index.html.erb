	<p class="body">Day 34 The horrors of this labyrinth never cease.  Today I thought I found an escape tunnel but it ended up placing me on a different part of this maze of horrors.  I donâ€™t know how I was placed in this awful system of tunnels, or why I was done so completely naked save a solitary bow on my head and a pair of high heels, but if I ever find the people who have done this to me, I will kill them.  I will kill them all.
